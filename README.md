# Laravel Breadcrumbs Test App

## Installing

This will only work on systems that support symlinks - i.e. not Windows!

```bash
git clone git@github.com:davejamesmiller/laravel-breadcrumbs-test.git
scripts/setup.sh
```

Point the document root at the `project/public/` directory and open up a web browser. There is a separate folder for each supported version of Laravel, each containing a test application.

Laravel Breadcrumbs itself will be installed in `breadcrumbs/`.
